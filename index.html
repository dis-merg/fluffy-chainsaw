                <h1>Some chains thrive, while others fall behind.</h1>
                <p>In early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States and upended the way Americans ate meals. Because government lockdown mandates were in place, and people were rightfully frightened of public spaces, Americans were not able to eat out at restaurants. This caused many fine dining and independently owned restaurants to scramble to create take out menus to serve a populace that still wanted their favorite restaurant meals.</p>
                <p>In the case of chain restaurants, some were uniquely positioned to prosper in this environment, such as pizza chains like Domino's and Papa Johns that already had robust delivery infrastructure. Some drive-through-heavy chains also did very well, like Chick-fil-A and Sonic. Chick-fil-A  Other chains like Dunkin' and Starbucks, that relied on customer commutes, did not do so well during 2020, as 35% of the total workforce and 70% of white collar workers were remote during this time<sup>1</sup>.</p>
                <p>Using the zoomable visualization above, the growth of the top 25 chain restaurants can investigated further. Each point represents one chain restaurant. The color encodes whether the restaurant chain has franchises or not, and the size of each point represents the average hourly pay for a worker at the chain. It is also possible to filter the chains by food service segment: Quick Service, Fast Casual, and Casual Dining.</p>

                    <p class="caption">Out of the top 25 chain restaurants shown in the visualization above, Domino's pizza had some of the most growth in number of restaurants and sales from 2019 to 2020. This can probably be attributed to a business model that centers around delivery, which thrived during the pandemic as people were stuck at home and unable to eat out. </p>
